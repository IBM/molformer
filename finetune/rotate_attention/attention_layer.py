        Using the same frame work as the fast_Transformers attention layer
        but injecting rotary information to the queries and the keys
        after the keys and queries are projected. 
        In the argument description we make use of the following sizes

            - N: the batch size
            - L: The maximum length of the queries
            - S: The maximum length of the keys (the actual length per sequence

              'd_model'

        Arguments
        ---------
            queries: (N, L, D) The tensor containing the queries
            keys: (N, S, D) The tensor containing the keys
            values: (N, S, D) The tensor containing the values
            attn_mask: An implementation of BaseMask that encodes where each
                       query can attend to
            query_lengths: An implementation of  BaseMask that encodes how
